# DSTI Python Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project is done in the scope of the DSTI Python ML course.
You can find the main project in the folder "MLproject".
You can find the app files in the folder "WebApp"


Here is the Web Application we created: https://cybersecurity-attack-type-prediction.streamlit.app/

How to use the app:
1) inside the folder MLmodel
2) download the file Encoded_Cybersecurity_Data.csv
3) open the app
4) drop the csv file in the dropbox and explore the models


The project include:

- a Jupyter Notebook to analyse the dataset cybersecurity_attack.csv and train the best ML model to predict the Attack Types
- a Web Application to show result of the model prediction (we used Streamlit)
- a report explaining the whole project and our decisions
- a GitHub page (where you are!)
- a video to show a short presentation of the Web Application


The Jupyter Notebook include 4 parts:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Encoding
- Modeling


The team working on this project is composed of:

- 2 Data Scientists: Yasmine El khdar, Gaia Bianciotto
- 1 Data Engineer: Marie-Caroline Bertheau
- 3 Data Analysts: Giti Shekari, Aubain Kokou Viglo, Anthony Baudchon
